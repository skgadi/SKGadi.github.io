  title={Design and Evaluation of the {LOPES} Exoskeleton Robot for Interactive Gait Rehabilitation},
  abstract={This paper introduces a newly developed gait rehabilitation device. The device, called {LOPES,} combines a freely translatable and {2-D-actuated} pelvis segment with a leg exoskeleton containing three actuated rotational joints: two at the hip and one at the knee. The joints are impedance controlled to allow bidirectional mechanical interaction between the robot and the training subject. Evaluation measurements show that the device allows both a "pa- tient-in-charge" and "robot-in-charge" mode, in which the robot is controlled either to follow or to guide a patient, respectively. Electromyography {(EMG)} measurements (one subject) on eight important leg muscles, show that free walking in the device strongly resembles free treadmill walking; an indication that the device can offer task-specific gait training. The possibilities and limitations to using the device as gait measurement tool are also shown at the moment position measurements are not accurate enough for inverse-dynamical gait analysis.}

  title={Assessment of motion of a swing leg and gait rehabilitation with a gravity balancing exoskeleton.},
  abstract={The gravity balancing exoskeleton, designed at University of Delaware, Newark, consists of rigid links, joints and springs, which are adjustable to the geometry and inertia of the leg of a human subject wearing it. This passive exoskeleton does not use any motors but is designed to unload the human leg joints from the gravity load over its range-of-motion. The underlying principle of gravity balancing is to make the potential energy of the combined leg-machine system invariant with configuration of the leg. Additionally, parameters of the exoskeleton can be changed to achieve a prescribed level of gravity assistance, from 0\% to 100\%. The goal of the results reported in this paper is to provide preliminary quantitative assessment of the changes in kinematics and kinetics of the walking gait when a human subject wears such an exoskeleton. The data on kinematics and kinetics were collected on four healthy and three stroke patients who wore this exoskeleton. These data were computed from the joint encoders and interface torque sensors mounted on the exoskeleton. This exoskeleton was also recently used for a six-week training of a chronic stroke patient, where the gravity assistance was progressively reduced from 100\% to 0\%. The results show a significant improvement in gait of the stroke patient in terms of range-of-motion of the hip and knee, weight bearing on the hemiparetic leg, and speed of walking. Currently, training studies are underway to assess the long-term effects of such a device on gait rehabilitation of hemiparetic stroke patients.}

  title={Inertia compensation control of a one-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton for lower-limb assistance: initial experiments.},
  abstract={A new method of lower-limb exoskeleton control aimed at improving the agility of leg-swing motion is presented. In the absence of control, an exoskeleton's mechanism usually hinders agility by adding mechanical impedance to the legs. The uncompensated inertia of the exoskeleton will reduce the natural frequency of leg swing, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking as well as increased metabolic energy consumption. The proposed controller emulates inertia compensation by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered angular acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain simulates negative inertia in the low-frequency range. The resulting controller combines two assistive effects: increasing the natural frequency of the lower limbs and performing net work per swing cycle. The controller was tested on a statically mounted exoskeleton that assists knee flexion and extension. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, in the context of a computer-based task resembling a race. In the exoskeleton's baseline state, the frequency of leg swing and the mean angular velocity were consistently reduced. The addition of inertia compensation enabled subjects to recover their normal frequency and increase their selected angular velocity. The work performed by the exoskeleton was evidenced by catch trials in the protocol.}

  abstract={Energetic autonomy of a hydraulic-based mobile robot requires a power source capable of both hydraulic and electrical power generation. The hydraulic power is used for locomotion, and the electric power is used for the control computer, sensors and other peripherals. In addition, the power source must be lightweight and quiet. This study presents several designs of internal combustion engine-based power units. Each power unit is evaluated with a Ragone plot which shows its performance over a wide range of operation times. Several hydraulic–electric power units {(HEPUs)} were built and successfully demonstrated on the Berkeley lower extremity exoskeleton {(BLEEX).} The best-performing design of the {HEPUs,} based upon the Ragone plot analysis, is described in detail. This {HEPU} produces constant pressure hydraulic power and constant voltage electric power. The pressure and voltage are controlled on board the power unit by a computer. A novel characteristic of this power unit is its cooling system in which hydraulic fluid is used to cool the engine cylinders. The prototype power unit weighs 27 kg and produces 2.3 {kW} (3.0 hp) hydraulic power at 6.9 {MPa} (1000 p.s.i.) and 220 W of electric power at 15 V {DC.}}

  abstract={Gait training of stroke survivors is crucial to facilitate neuromuscular plasticity needed for improvements in functional walking ability. Robot assisted gait training {(RAGT)} was developed for stroke survivors using active leg exoskeleton {(ALEX)} and a force-field controller, which uses assist-as-needed paradigm for rehabilitation. In this paradigm undesirable gait motion is resisted and assistance is provided towards desired motion. The force-field controller achieves this paradigm by effectively applying forces at the ankle of the subject through actuators on the hip and knee joints. Two stroke survivors participated in a 15-session gait training study each with {ALEX.} The results show that by the end of the training the gait pattern of the patients improved and became closer to a healthy subject's gait pattern. Improvement is seen as an increase in the size of the patients' gait pattern, increased knee and ankle joint excursions and increase in their walking speeds on the treadmill.}

  abstract={1. We have investigated the relative contributions of mechanical and reflex mechanisms in generating the forces produced by the neck muscles when loads were unexpectedly applied during centrally programmed head movements in monkeys. These movements, subserved by muscles well endowed with muscle spindles, are part of the coordinated eye-head response to the appearance of a stimulus in the animal's visual field. Our preparation was a chronically vestibulectomized monkey trained to make a visual discrimination. 2. Two procedures were used to evaluate the torque generated by the neck musculature when an unexpected load disturbance was applied: first, by surgically interrupting the afferent loop subserving the reflex action (section of cervical dorsal roots) and second, by building a mathematical model of the head-neck system and carrying out a process of simulation. 3. Our results indicated that the compensatory torque of reflex origin stimulated by the application of an opposing force was less than 10--30\% of that required for perfect compensation, and the larger fraction of the observed compensation was due to the mechanical properties (inertial, viscous, and elastic) of the neck musculature. The combined action of reflex and mechanical processes never completely compensated for the disturbance.}

  title={Changes in the surface {EMG} signal and the biomechanics of motion during a repetitive lifting task.},
  abstract={The analysis of surface electromyographic {(EMG)} data recorded from the muscles of the back during isometric constant-force contractions has been a useful tool for assessing muscle deficits in patients with lower back pain {(LBP).} Until recently, extending the technique to dynamic tasks, such as lifting, has not been possible due to the nonstationarity of the {EMG} signals. Recent developments in time-frequency analysis procedures to compute the instantaneous median frequency {(IMDF)} were utilized in this study to overcome these limitations. Healthy control subjects with no history of {LBP} (n = 9; mean age 26.3 +/- 6.7) were instrumented for acquisition of surface {EMG} data from six electrodes on the thoraco-lumbar region and whole-body kinematic data from a stereo-photogrammetric system. Data were recorded during a standardized repetitive lifting task (load = 15\% body mass; 12 lifts/min; 5-min duration). The task resulted in significant decreases in {IMDF} for six of the nine subjects, with a symmetrical pattern of fatigue among contralateral muscles and greater decrements in the lower lumbar region. For those subjects with a significant decrease in {IMDF,} a lower limb and/or upper limb biomechanical adaptation to fatigue was observed during the task. Increases in the peak box acceleration were documented. In two subjects, the acceleration doubled its value from the beginning to the end of the exercise, which lead to a significant increase in the torque at {L4/L5.} This observation suggests an association between muscle fatigue at the lumbar region and the way the subject manipulates the box during the exercise. Fatigue-related biomechanical adaptations are discussed as a possible supplement to functional capacity assessments among patients with {LBP.}}

  abstract={The activity of 156 neurons was recorded in the premotor cortex {(Weinrich} and Wise 1982) and in an adjoining rostral region of area 6 (area 6 {DR;} Barbas and Pandya 1987) while monkeys made visually-guided arm movements of similar direction within different parts of space. The activity of individual neurons varied most for a given preferred direction of movement within each part of space. These neurons (152/156, 97.4\%) were labeled as directional. The spatial orientation of their preferred directions shifted in space to "follow" the rotation of the shoulder joint necessary to bring the arm into the different parts of the work-space. These results suggest that the cortical areas studied represent arm movement direction within a coordinate system rotating with the arm and where signals about the movement direction relate to the motor plan through a simple invariant relationship, that between cell preferred direction and arm orientation in space.}

  abstract={The activity of 156 individual arm-related neurons was studied in the premotor cortex (area 6) while monkeys made arm movements of similar directions within different parts of 3-dimensional space. This study was aimed at describing the relationship between premotor cortical cell activity and direction of arm movement and assessing the coordinate system underlying this relationship. We found that the activity of 152 (97.4\%) cells varied in an orderly fashion with the direction of movement, in at least some region of the work space. Premotor cortical cells fired most for a given preferred direction and less for other directions of movement. These preferred directions covered the directional continuum in a uniform fashion across the work space. It was found that, as movements of similar directions were made within different parts of the work space, the cells' preferred directions changed their orientation. Although these changes had different magnitudes for different cells, at the population level, they followed closely the changes in orientation of the arm necessary to move the hand from one to another part of the work space. This shift of cells' preferred direction with the orientation of the arm in space has been observed with similar characteristics in the motor cortex (see Caminiti et al., 1990). In both premotor and motor cortices, neuronal movement population vectors provide a good description of movement direction. Unlike the individual cell preferred directions upon which they are based, movement population vectors did not change their spatial orientation across the work space, suggesting that they remain good predictors of movement direction regardless of the region of space in which movements are made. The firing frequency of both premotor and motor cortical neurons varied significantly with the position occupied by the hand in space. These static positional effects were observed in 88.5\% of premotor and 91.8\% of motor cortical cells. In a second task, monkeys made movements from differing origins to a common end point. This task was performed within 3 different parts of space and was aimed at dissociating movement direction from movement end point. It was found that in both premotor and motor cortices virtually all cells were related to the direction and not to the end point of movement. These data suggest that premotor and motor cortices use common mechanisms for coding arm movement direction. They also provide a basis for understanding the coordinate transformation required to move the hand toward visual targets in space.}

  abstract={The palmar pinch force estimation is highly relevant not only in biomechanical studies, the analysis of sports activities, and ergonomic design analyses but also in clinical applications such as rehabilitation, in which information about muscle forces influences the physician's decisions on diagnosis and treatment. Force transducers have been used for such purposes, but they are restricted to grasping points and inevitably interfere with the human haptic sense because fingers cannot directly touch the environmental surface. We propose an estimation method of the palmar pinch force using surface electromyography {(SEMG).} Three myoelectric sites on the skin were selected on the basis of anatomical considerations and a Fisher discriminant analysis {(FDA),} and {SEMG} at these sites yields suitable information for pinch force estimation. An artificial neural network {(ANN)} was implemented to map the {SEMG} to the force, and its structure was optimized to avoid both under- and over-fitting problems. The resulting network was tested using {SEMG} signals recorded from the selected myoelectric sites of ten subjects in real time. The training time for each subject was short (approximately 96s), and the estimation results were promising, with a normalized root mean squared error {(NRMSE)} of 0.081+/-0.023 and a correlation {(CORR)} of 0.968+/-0.017.}

  title={Control of human arm movements in two dimensions: paths and joint control in avoiding simple linear obstacles},
  abstract={In order to examine path planning and the control of redundant degrees of freedom in the human arm, the movements of the shoulder, elbow and wrist were recorded as subjects moved a pointer to a target and avoided a simple obstacle. With respect to joint control, the results show that the extra degree of freedom provided by the wrist is incorporated into target movements in a systematic manner for both large and small obstacles; it is not used only when there is no geometrical alternative. For the wrist, two strategies are apparent, depending upon the length of the obstacle. Wrist extension predominates for shorter obstacles, while flexion or extension and flexion predominate for longer obstacles. These wrist movements shorten the effective length of the distal segments (lower arm plus hand and pointer) and thus reduce the excursion required at the proximal joints. In part, they correspond to assuming the most comfortable arm configuration at each point in the new path necessitated by the obstacle and can be described by static cost functions. However, wrist extension is also used to move the hand and pointer away from the obstacle as shoulder and elbow movements carry the wrist itself towards the obstacle. Wrist flexion is also used to move the pointer tip rapidly past the obstacle. These components, which cannot be explained by static cost functions alone, confirm for the human arm the hypothesized use of redundant degrees of freedom in obstacle avoidance. With respect to path planning, the results show that the minimum distance between pointer and obstacle remains fairly constant over a large range of obstacle lengths; this relative invariance is interpreted to support the hypothesis that workspace coordinates are important for movement planning. However, minimum distance and several other path parameters do depend significantly on the orientation and location of the movement in the workspace. This inhomogeneity implies that movement planning does not occur exclusively in workspace coordinates; it suggests an influence of joint space criteria. In frontal movements, for example, the systematic decline in the minimum distance with increasing obstacle length is interpreted as a compromise reducing the amount of extra joint movement and the discomfort of arm configurations.}

  abstract={The role of afferent inflow and efferent outflow (or command) signals in judgements of limb position has been debated for over a century. One way to assess this is to check for changes during complete paralysis, with the current view being that perceived movements or position changes do not usually accompany attempts to contract paralysed muscles. To re-examine this, we asked six na{\"i}ve subjects to carry out a simple position-matching task at the wrist. In the absence of vision, subjects accurately perceived the position to which their right wrist had been moved by the experimenter by matching it with their left hand. There was no significant change in perception when position was matched during sustained flexion or extension efforts. Then we paralysed and anaesthetized the right arm with ischaemia in order to produce a 'phantom' hand. The perceived position of the wrist changed by more than 20 deg when subjects attempted to flex or extend their hand when it was paralysed and anaesthetized. Further studies showed that this illusion was not dependent on the way in which the paralysis was produced and that the size of the position illusion increased when the level of effort during paralysis increased. These results establish for the first time a definitive role for 'outflow' signals in position sense.}

  title={Accuracy of weight estimation for weights lifted by proximal and distal muscles of the human upper limb.},
  abstract={It is well established that tactile acuity is greater over digits than over the proximal parts of the upper limb and that the corticospinal projection is especially dense for distal muscles. To determine whether the acuity for judgements of forces exerted by distal muscles differed from that for proximal muscles, a weight-matching task was used with first dorsal interosseous, flexor pollicus longus and elbow flexors. 2. Reference weights equivalent to approximately 3\% (light) and 15\% (heavy) of the maximal voluntary contraction were lifted by one muscle group on the left. They were matched with a variable weight, lifted by the same group, on the right. 3. In naive subjects, the coefficient of variation for repeated estimates of perceived heaviness was significantly lower for proximal than distal muscles. Measured in this way, ‘accuracy’ (i.e. reproducibility of the estimates) was not greater for the intrinsic muscles of the hand. This result could not be explained by the way in which the weights were supported by the index finger. When the data were expressed as the relative difference between the reference and the matched weight, each muscle group behaved similarly. 4. For a particular muscle, accuracy was greater when the heavy rather than the light weights were lifted. 5. Given that estimates of forces and heaviness are biased by signals of central motor command {(McCloskey,} 1981; Gandevia, 1987; Cafarelli, 1988; Jones, 1988). these signals could be graded no more finely for distal than proximal muscles. Furthermore, relative accuracy was greater for forces at the high rather than the low end of the comfortable ‘matching’ range of force for a particular muscle.}

In order to achieve an exoskeleton controller which reacts compliantly to external forces, an accurate model of the dynamics of the system is required. In this report, a series of system identification experiments was designed and carried out for {BLEEX.} As well as determining the mass and inertia properties of the segments of the legs, various non-ideal elements, such as friction, stiffness and damping forces, are identified. The resulting dynamic model is found to be significantly more accurate than the original model predicted from the designs of the robot.}

  abstract={We used a lower limb robotic exoskeleton controlled by the wearer's muscle activity to study human locomotor adaptation to disrupted muscular coordination. Ten healthy subjects walked while wearing a pneumatically powered ankle exoskeleton on one limb that effectively increased plantar flexor strength of the soleus muscle. Soleus electromyography amplitude controlled plantar flexion assistance from the exoskeleton in real time. We hypothesized that subjects' gait kinematics would be initially distorted by the added exoskeleton power, but that subjects would reduce soleus muscle recruitment with practice to return to gait kinematics more similar to normal. We also examined the ability of subjects to recall their adapted motor pattern for exoskeleton walking by testing subjects on two separate sessions, 3 days apart. The mechanical power added by the exoskeleton greatly perturbed ankle joint movements at first, causing subjects to walk with significantly increased plantar flexion during stance. With practice, subjects reduced soleus recruitment by approximately 35\% and learned to use the exoskeleton to perform almost exclusively positive work about the ankle. Subjects demonstrated the ability to retain the adapted locomotor pattern between testing sessions as evidenced by similar muscle activity, kinematic and kinetic patterns between the end of the first test day and the beginning of the second. These results demonstrate that robotic exoskeletons controlled by muscle activity could be useful tools for testing neural mechanisms of human locomotor adaptation.}

Measurements were taken with participants, 10 {US} Army enlisted men, standing on a force platform. The men were tested with and without the {EXO} (15 kg) while carrying military loads of 20, 40 and 55 kg. Body lean to the left and right was significantly less and postural sway excursions and maximal range of movement were significantly reduced when the {EXO} was used. Hurst values indicated that body sway was less random over short-term time intervals and more random over long-term intervals with the {EXO} than without it. Feedback to the user's balance control mechanisms most likely was changed with the {EXO.} The reduced sway and relatively small changes in sway with increasing load weights suggest that the {EXO} structure may have functioned to provide a bracing effect on the body.}

This system is analyzed here, based on the two engineering requirements for man made servo systems, namely the system loop gain and the steady state error {(Gille,} 1959). In the first part the system's linearized transfer function equations are developed. It is shown that the small loop gain found in the reflex studies indicates a small gain under volitional control of movements, i.e. volitional control is being exercised directly by the alpha or gamma system. For the steady state error no definite conclusions can be drawn from the available data {(Rosenthal,} 1970; Houk, 1963); however, it is shown to be inversely proportional to the steady state loop gain, and the system is thus of type “0” or “1”.}

  abstract={We predict the virtual trajectories and stiffness ellipses during multijoint arm movements by computer simulations. A two-link manipulator with four single-joint muscles and two double-joint muscles is used as a model of the human arm. Physical parameters of the model are derived from several experimental data. Among them, special emphasis is put on low values of the dynamic hand stiffness recently measured during single joint and multijoint movements. The feedback-error-learning scheme to acquire the inverse dynamics model and the inverse statics model is utilized for this prediction. The virtual trajectories are much more complex than the actual trajectories. This indicates that planning the virtual trajectory is as difficult as solving the inverse dynamics problem for medium and fast movements, and simply falsifies the advocated computational advantage of the virtual trajectory control hypothesis. Thus, we conclude that learning inverse models is essential even in the virtual trajectory control framework. Finally, we propose a new computational model to learn the complicated shape of the virtual trajectories by integrating the virtual trajectory control and the feedback-error-learning scheme.}

The first stage of the trials, described in this paper, involved the participation of one hemiplegic patient who is not able to bend his right knee. As a result, the motion support provided by the {HAL} moved the paralyzed knee joint according to his intention and improved the range of the subject's knee flexion. The first evaluation of the control method with one subject showed promising results for future trials to explore the effectiveness for a wide range of types of hemiplegia.}

These concepts are supported by behavioral, neurophysiological, and imaging data; furthermore, these models have had their structures and functions revealed by such data. In particular, a specific theory on inverse dynamics model learning is directly supported by unit recordings from cerebellar Purkinje cells. Multiple paired forward inverse models describing how diverse objects and environments can be controlled and learned separately have recently been proposed. The ‘minimum variance model’ is another major recent advance in the computational theory of motor control. This model integrates two furiously disputed approaches on trajectory planning, strongly suggesting that both kinematic and dynamic internal models are utilized in movement planning and control.}

The reason for this was twofold; firstly, one could envision a~great many applications for either a~stand-alone lower- or upper-extremity exoskeleton in the immediate future. Secondly, and more importantly for the division, is that these exoskeletons are in their early stages, and further research still needs to be conducted to ensure that the upper-extremity exoskeleton and lower-extremity exoskeleton can function well independently before one can venture an attempt to integrate them.

  abstract={The purpose of this study was to experimentally investigate the applicability of the equilibrium-point hypothesis to the dynamics of single-joint movements. Subjects were trained to perform relatively slow (movement time 600-1000 ms) or fast (movement time 200-300 ms) single-joint elbow flexion movements against a constant extending torque bias. They were instructed to reproduce the same time pattern of central motor command for a series of movements when the external torque could slowly and unpredictably increase, decrease, or remain constant. For fast movements, the total muscle torque was calculated as a sum of external and inertial components. Analysis of the data allowed reconstruction of the elbow joint compliant characteristics at different times during execution of the learned motor command. {"Virtual"} trajectories of the movements, representing time-varying changes in a central control parameter, were reconstructed and compared with the "actual" trajectories. For slow movements, the actual trajectories lagged behind the virtual ones. There were no consistent changes in the joint stiffness during slow movements. Similar analysis of experiments without voluntary movements demonstrated a lack of changes in the central parameters, supporting the assumption that the subjects were able to keep the same central motor command in spite of externally imposed unexpected torque perturbations. For the fast movements, the virtual trajectories were N-shaped, and the joint stiffness demonstrated a considerable increase near the middle of the movement. These findings contradict an hypothesis of monotonic joint compliant characteristic translation at a nearly constant rate during such movements.}

Time-optimal control theory is used to characterize one form of human behavior. Other behavioral aspects are quantified by the two predominant models in current use—a structurally isomorphic cause-effect model and an algorithmic model utilizing linear-quadratic-gaussian optimal control. Many of the procedures developed to achieve practical utility for these models have parallels useful for automatic control as well.}

  abstract={We hypothesized that the moment arms of muscles crossing the elbow vary substantially with forearm and elbow position and that these variations could be represented using a three-dimensional computer model. Flexion/extension and pronation/supination moment arms of the brachioradialis, biceps, brachialis, pronator teres, and triceps were calculated from measurements of tendon displacement and joint angle in two anatomic specimens and were estimated using a computer model of the elbow joint. The anatomical measurements revealed that the flexion/extension moment arms varied by at least 30\% over a 95 degrees range of motion. The changes in flexion/extension moment arm magnitudes with elbow flexion angle were represented well by the computer model. The anatomical studies and the computer model demonstrate that the biceps flexion moment arm peaks in a more extended elbow position and has a larger peak when the forearm is supinated. Also, the peak biceps supination moment arm decreases as the elbow is extended. These results emphasize the need to account for the variation of muscle moment arms with elbow flexion and forearm position.}

The finger pad responded in a linearly viscoelastic manner during loading, but exhibited highly nonlinear behavior upon unloading. The observed tangential force {(F(T))} relaxations were nonlinear and could be modeled well by a logarithmic function. The average {F(T)} relaxation duration (tau) was 11.8 s. Apparent tangential stiffness {(kT),} determined by {F(T)} after relaxation, varied linearly with normal force. With the {DIP} joints constrained the fingers showed significantly larger stiffness than with the {PIP} joints constrained (p{\textless}0.001). Implications for finger force coordination studies are discussed.}

  abstract={1. By subdividing ventral roots and supplying stimulating pulses to different groups of motor units in rotation, smooth contractions of soleus could be obtained with low rates of stimulation.2. Isometric tension was recorded with different rates of stimulation, and at different muscle lengths.3. Longitudinal histological sections were cut from muscles fixed at different lengths, and sarcomeres were measured. Mean sarcomere lengths in soleus could then be related to the angle at the ankle.4. At high rates of stimulation the maximum active tension was obtained at a length corresponding to an angle of about 60 degrees at the ankle, and a mean sarcomere length of about 2.8 mu. The isometric tension fell only slightly on shortening the muscle to a length equivalent to 100 degrees , and a mean sarcomere length about 2.3 mu. Further shortening caused a marked fall in tension.5. There was a reciprocal relationship between stimulus rate and muscle length; when the muscle was long low rates of stimulation gave near maximal tension, whereas at short lengths the maximum tension was reached only when the stimulus rate was very high. It is suggested that stimulating pulses activate the contractile machinery of the muscle more effectively at long than at short muscle lengths.6. When at low rates of stimulation pulses were distributed among the motor units in rotation to give a smooth contraction, the tension rose higher than during the unfused tetanus that accompanied synchronous stimulation of the same motor units at the same rate. It is suggested that in an unfused tetanus internal movement of the muscle reduces the tension below that developed in a truly isometric state.7. The rate of rise of tension in an isometric tetanus varied with both muscle length and rate of stimulation. At each stimulus rate there was a range of lengths in which the isometric tension developed slowly, this was the same length range in which, at that stimulus rate, the length tension curve was steep.}

The {WREX,} a four-degrees-of-freedom functional orthosis, is energized by rubber bands to eliminate gravity and is attached to the wheelchair. The development and clinical testing of {WREX} is described in this report. Seventeen patients (14 boys and 3 girls) with muscular disabilities participated in the study. Ages ranged from 4 to 20 years. Criteria for inclusion included a weakened arm, use of a wheelchair, the ability to grasp and release objects, and the ability to provide feedback on device use. Testing consisted of administering the Jebsen test of hand function without {WREX} and then testing again after approximately two weeks of wearing the {WREX} orthosis. The timed results of each task within the test then were compared. Specific tasks related to vertical movement required less time to perform with the {WREX.} A large number of subjects were able to perform the Jebsen tasks with the {WREX,} where they were unable to perform the task without the {WREX.} Patients can benefit from {WREX} because it increases their performance in daily living activities and makes many tasks possible. The range-of-motion in the patients' arms increased considerably, while the time required to complete some of the Jebsen test tasks decreased. Most patients were very receptive to {WREX,} although a few were ambivalent.}

  abstract={Muscle models are the essential components of any musculoskeletal simulation. In addition, muscle models which are incorporated in neural-based prosthetic and orthotic devices may significantly improve their performance. The aim of the study was to compare the performances of two types of muscle models in terms of predicting the moments developed at the human elbow joint complex based on joint kinematics and neuromuscular activity. The performance evaluation of the muscle models was required to implement them in a powered myosignal-driven exoskeleton (orthotic device). The experimental setup included a passive exoskeleton capable of measuring the joint kinematics and dynamics in addition to the muscle myosignal activity {(EMG).} Two types of models were developed and analyzed: (i) a Hill-based model and (ii) a neural network. The task, which was selected for evaluating the muscle models performance, was the flexion-extension movement of the forearm with a hand-held weight. For this task the muscle model inputs were the normalized neural activation levels of the four main flexor-extensor muscles of the elbow joint, and the elbow joint angle and angular velocity. Using this inputs, the muscle model predicted the moment applied on the elbow joint during the movement. Results indicated a good performance of the Hill model, although the neural network predictions appeared to be superior. Relative advantages and shortcomings of both approaches were presented and discussed.}

  title={Human-robot synchrony: flexible assistance using adaptive oscillators.},
  abstract={We propose a novel method for movement assistance that is based on adaptive oscillators, i.e., mathematical tools that are capable of extracting the high-level features (amplitude, frequency, and offset) of a periodic signal. Such an oscillator acts like a filter on these features, but keeps its output in phase with respect to the input signal. Using a simple inverse model, we predicted the torque produced by human participants during rhythmic flexion-extension of the elbow. Feeding back a fraction of this estimated torque to the participant through an elbow exoskeleton, we were able to prove the assistance efficiency through a marked decrease of the biceps and triceps electromyography. Importantly, since the oscillator adapted to the movement imposed by the user, the method flexibly allowed us to change the movement pattern and was still efficient during the nonstationary epochs. This method holds promise for the development of new robot-assisted rehabilitation protocols because it does not require prespecifying a reference trajectory and does not require complex signal sensing or single-user calibration: the only signal that is measured is the position of the augmented joint. In this paper, we further demonstrate that this assistance was very intuitive for the participants who adapted almost instantaneously.}

  title={Role of the cerebellum in reaching movements in humans. I. Distributed inverse dynamics control.},
  abstract={This study focuses on the role of the motor cortex, the spinal cord and the cerebellum in the dynamics stage of the control of arm movement. Currently, two classes of models have been proposed for the neural control of movements, namely the virtual trajectory control hypothesis and the acquisition of internal models of the motor apparatus hypothesis. In the present study, we expand the virtual trajectory model to whole arm reaching movements. This expanded model accurately reproduced slow movements, but faster reaching movements deviated significantly from the planned trajectories, indicating that for fast movements, this model was not sufficient. These results led us to propose a new distributed functional model consistent with behavioural, anatomical and neurophysiological data, which takes into account arm muscles, spinal cord, motor cortex and cerebellum and is consistent with the view that the central nervous system acquires a distributed inverse dynamics model of the arm. Previous studies indicated that the cerebellum compensates for the interaction forces that arise during reaching movements. We show here how the cerebellum may increase the accuracy of reaching movements by compensating for the interaction torques by learning a portion of an inverse dynamics model that refines a basic inverse model in the motor cortex and spinal cord.}

  title={Role of the cerebellum in reaching movements in humans. {II.} A neural model of the intermediate cerebellum.},
  abstract={The cerebellum is essential for the control of multijoint movements; when the cerebellum is lesioned, the performance error is more than the summed errors produced by single joints. In the companion paper {(Schweighofer} et al., 1998), a functional anatomical model for visually guided arm movement was proposed. The model comprised a basic feedforward/feedback controller with realistic transmission delays and was connected to a two-link, six-muscle, planar arm. In the present study, we examined the role of the cerebellum in reaching movements by embedding a novel, detailed cerebellar neural network in this functional control model. We could derive realistic cerebellar inputs and the role of the cerebellum in learning to control the arm was assessed. This cerebellar network learned the part of the inverse dynamics of the arm not provided by the basic feedforward/feedback controller. Despite realistically low inferior olive firing rates and noisy mossy fibre inputs, the model could reduce the error between intended and planned movements. The responses of the different cell groups were comparable to those of biological cell groups. In particular, the modelled Purkinje cells exhibited directional tuning after learning and the parallel fibres, due to their length, provide Purkinje cells with the input required for this coordination task. The inferior olive responses contained two different components; the earlier response, locked to movement onset, was always present and the later response disappeared after learning. These results support the theory that the cerebellum is involved in motor learning.}

  title={Multiple Reference Frames for Motion in the Primate Cerebellum},
  abstract={Knowledge of body motion through space is necessary for spatial orientation, self-motion perception, and postural control. Yet, sensory afferent signals may not directly provide such information to the brain. Because motion detected by the vestibular end organs is encoded in a head-fixed frame of reference, a coordinate transformation is thus required to encode body motion. In this study, we investigated whether cerebellar motion-sensitive neurons encode the translation of the body through space. We systematically changed both the direction of motion relative to the body and the static orientation of the head relative to the trunk. The activities of motion-sensitive neurons in the most medial of the deep cerebellar nuclei, the rostral fastigial nucleus, were compared with those in the brainstem vestibular nuclei. We found a distributed representation of reference frames for motion in the rostral fastigial nucleus, in contrast to cells in the vestibular nuclei, which primarily encoded motion in a head-fixed reference frame. This differential representation of motion-related information implies potential differences in the functional roles of these areas.}

In this letter I propose a set of joint-related coordinate systems that rotate with the posture of the arm in which populations of motor cortical neurons code direction of the arm movement. In these frames of reference, the movement directions represented vary with the posture of the arm but the preferred directions of the motor cortical neurons do not rotate. It is suggested that the difference in the neuronal activity for different workspaces, which was observed by Caminiti et al., is due to the dependence of the movement direction, represented in one of the joint-related coordinate systems, on the posture of the arm.}

Marker positions were tracked by a six-camera optoelectronic system {(VICON} 460, Oxford Metrics). The purpose of this study was to determine if this method could discriminate between medial osteoarthritic and asymptomatic knees during gait. Nine patients with osteoarthritic knees and nine asymptomatic control subjects were included in this study. Eighteen parameters representing maximal, minimal, and range of acceleration values were extracted during the loading and preswing to mid-swing phase periods, and were compared in both groups. Results show good discriminative capacity of the new method. Eight parameters were significantly different between both groups.

Desired states for one (disabled) leg are generated online based on the movements of the other (sound) leg. An instantaneous mapping between legs is performed by exploiting physiological interjoint couplings. This way, the patient generates the reference motion for the affected leg autonomously. The approach, called Complementary Limb Motion Estimation {(CLME),} is implemented on the {LOPES} gait rehabilitation robot and evaluated with healthy subjects in two different experiments. In a previously described study, subjects walk only with one leg, while the robot's other leg acts as a fake prosthesis, to simulate complete loss of function in one leg. This study showed that {CLME} ensures stable gait. In a second study, to be presented in this paper, healthy subjects walk with both their own legs to assess the interference with self-determined walking. Evaluation criteria are: Power delivered to the joints by the robot, electromyography {(EMG)} distortions, and kinematic distortions, all compared to zero torque control, which is the baseline of minimum achievable interference. Results indicate that interference of the robot is lower with {CLME} than with a fixed reference trajectory, mainly in terms of lowered exchanged power and less alteration of {EMG.} This implies that subjects can walk more naturally with {CLME,} and they are assisted less by the robot when it is not needed. Future studies with patients are yet to show whether these properties of {CLME} transfer to the clinical domain.}

  title={Second generation pleated pneumatic artificial muscle and its robotic applications},
  abstract={This paper reports on the second generation of the pleated pneumatic artificial muscle {(PPAM)} which has been developed to extend the lifespan of its first prototype. This type of artificial muscle was developed to overcome dry friction and material deformation which is present in the widely used {McKibben} muscle. The essence of the {PPAM} is its pleated membrane structure which enables the muscle to work at low pressures and at large contractions. There is growing interest in this kind of actuation for robotics applications due to its high power to weight ratio and adaptable compliance, especially for legged locomotion and robot applications in direct contact with a human. This paper describes the design of the second-generation {PPAM,} for which specifically the membrane layout has been changed. In terms of this new layout the mathematical model, developed for the first prototype, has been reformulated. This paper gives an elaborate discussion on this mathematical model that represents the force generation and enclosed muscle volume. Static load tests on some real muscles, which have been carried out in order to validate the mathematical model, are then discussed. Furthermore, two robotic applications are given which successfully use these pneumatic artificial muscles. One is the biped Lucy and the another one is a manipulator application which works in direct contact with an operator.}

  abstract={Hand injuries are a frequent problem. The great amount of hand injuries is not only a problem for the affected people but economic consequences follow because rehabilitation takes a long time. To improve therapy results and reduce cost of rehabilitation a hand exoskeleton was developed. For research on control algorithms and rehabilitation programs a prototype supporting all four degrees of freedom of one finger was build (s. Fig. 1). In view of the fact that a lot of hand injuries affect only one finger, this prototype could already be functional in physical therapy. A robust sliding mode controller was proposed for motion control of the hand exoskeleton. The performance of the proposed controller was verified in real experiments and compared to that of traditional {PID} controller.}

  title={Modulation of stretch reflex by anticipation of the stimulus through visual information},
  abstract={A stretch stimulus was applied to the right elbow flexor by the free gravitational fall of a weight. The subject was instructed to flex the elbow joint to lift the weight quickly (resist task) or to extend the elbow joint to overtake the falling weight (assist task) as the voluntary reaction to the stretch stimulus. In the resist task, when the subject could predict the time of stretch stimulus onset by watching through the mirror the behavior of the experimenter going to give the stretch stimulus, the integrated {EMG} {(I-EMG)} of M 2 (50–80 ms after the stimulus onset) and M3 (80–100 ms) components of stretch reflex were significantly enhanced compared with when the experimenter's movements were invisible to the subject, while no differences were observed in the background discharge before the stretch stimulus onset {(BGA)} and the short latency reflex {(M1).} In the assist task, the M2 and M3 were depressed when the visual information about the stimulus presentation was available, while the {BGA} and M1 were unchanged. From these results, it is suggested that (1) the preparatory set should be classified into two categories, i.e., task-related “topographical set” and timing-related “chronographic set”, and (2) visual information about the process of stimulus presentation can modulate the reflex activity of stretched muscle allowing the required task to be executed efficiently by accurately anticipating the stretch stimulus onset.}
